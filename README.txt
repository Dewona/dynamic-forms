! USED angular 6
* Directories 'ui' and 'api' in 'dynamic-forms' are my previously written applications for research some Angular features. For the presentation I added some display functionality and wrote this technical note. First of all you must have NodeJs and npm. Open terminale on root directory of UI part of application (named 'ui'). Use command 'npm install' for installing packages based on a 'package.json'. I used Angular CLI and if you have it installed you can use 'ng serve' command on root directory to start application. If you have not installed CLI you can use 'npm start' or install CLI global: 'npm install -g @angular/cli'. For start api you need to open directory 'api' and write commands 'npm install' and 'node app.js' in terminal. I left hard coded configs if you don't want to use api, and I added functionality to use this configs in UI.
